When a word sense disambiguation (WSD)
system is trained on one domain but ap-
plied to a different domain, a drop in ac-
curacy is frequently observed. This high-
lights the importance of domain adaptation
for word sense disambiguation. In this pa-
per, we first show that an active learning ap-
proach can be successfully used to perform
domain adaptation of WSD systems. Then,
by using the predominant sense predicted by
expectation-maximization (EM) and adopt-
ing a count-merging technique, we improve
the effectiveness of the original adaptation
process achieved by the basic active learn-
ing approach.

<bodyText confidence="0.99936044">
In natural language, a word often assumes different
meanings, and the task of determining the correct
meaning, or sense, of a word in different contexts
is known as word sense disambiguation (WSD). To
date, the best performing systems in WSD use a
corpus-based, supervised learning approach. With
this approach, one would need to collect a text cor-
pus, in which each ambiguous word occurrence is
first tagged with its correct sense to serve as training
data.
The reliance of supervised WSD systems on an-
notated corpus raises the important issue of do-
main dependence. To investigate this, Escudero
et al. (2000) and Martinez and Agirre (2000) con-
ducted experiments using the DSO corpus, which
49
contains sentences from two different corpora,
namely Brown Corpus (BC) and Wall Street Jour-
nal (WSJ). They found that training a WSD system
on one part (BC or WSJ) of the DSO corpus, and
applying it to the other, can result in an accuracy
drop of more than 10%, highlighting the need to per-
form domain adaptation of WSD systems to new do-
mains. Escudero et al. (2000) pointed out that one
of the reasons for the drop in accuracy is the dif-
ference in sense priors (i.e., the proportions of the
different senses of a word) between BC and WSJ.
When the authors assumed they knew the sense pri-
ors of each word in BC and WSJ, and adjusted these
two datasets such that the proportions of the differ-
ent senses of each word were the same between BC
and WSJ, accuracy improved by 9%.
In this paper, we explore domain adaptation of
WSD systems, by adding training examples from the
new domain as additional training data to a WSD
system. To reduce the effort required to adapt a
WSD system to a new domain, we employ an ac-
tive learning strategy (Lewis and Gale, 1994) to se-
lect examples to annotate from the new domain of
interest. To our knowledge, our work is the first to
use active learning for domain adaptation for WSD.
A similar work is the recent research by Chen et al.
(2006), where active learning was used successfully
to reduce the annotation effort for WSD of 5 English
verbs using coarse-grained evaluation. In that work,
the authors only used active learning to reduce the
annotation effort and did not deal with the porting of
a WSD system to a new domain.
Domain adaptation is necessary when the train-
ing and target domains are different. In this paper,

show that for the set of nouns which have different
predominant senses between the training and target
domains, we are able to reduce the annotation effort
by 71%.
2 Experimental Setting
In this section, we discuss the motivations for choos-
ing the particular corpus and the set of nouns to con-
duct our domain adaptation experiments.
2.1 Choice of Corpus
The DSO corpus (Ng and Lee, 1996) contains
192,800 annotated examples for 121 nouns and 70
verbs, drawn from BC and WSJ. While the BC is
built as a balanced corpus, containing texts in var-
ious categories such as religion, politics, humani-
ties, fiction, etc, the WSJ corpus consists primarily
of business and financial news. Exploiting the dif-
ference in coverage between these two corpora, Es-
cudero et al. (2000) separated the DSO corpus into
50
2.2 Choice of Nouns
The WordNet Domains resource (Magnini and
Cavaglia, 2000) assigns domain labels to synsets in
WordNet. Since the focus of the WSJ corpus is on
business and financial news, we can make use of
WordNet Domains to select the set of nouns having
at least one synset labeled with a business or finance
related domain label. This is similar to the approach
taken in (Koeling et al., 2005) where they focus on
determining the predominant sense of words in cor-
pora drawn from finance versus sports domains.1
Hence, we select the subset of DSO nouns that have
at least one synset labeled with any of these domain
labels: commerce, enterprise, money, finance, bank-
ing, and economy. This gives a set of 21 nouns:
book, business, center, community, condition, field,
figure, house, interest, land, line, money, need, num-
ber, order, part, power, society, term, use, value.2
For each noun, all the BC examples are used as
out-of-domain training data. One-third of the WSJ
examples for each noun are set aside as evaluation
1Note however that the coverage of the WordNet Domains
resource is not comprehensive, as about 31% of the synsets are
simply labeled with “factotum”, indicating that the synset does
not belong to a specific domain.
225 nouns have at least one synset labeled with the listed
domain labels. In our experiments, 4 out of these 25 nouns have
an accuracy of more than 90% before adaptation (i.e., training
on just the BC examples) and accuracy improvement is less than
1% after all the available WSJ adaptation examples are added
as additional training data. To obtain a clearer picture of the
adaptation process, we discard these 4 nouns, leaving a set of

data, and the rest of the WSJ examples are desig-
nated as in-domain adaptation data. The row 21
nouns in Table 1 shows some information about
these 21 nouns. For instance, these nouns have an
average of 6.7 senses in BC and 6.8 senses in WSJ.
This is slightly higher than the 5.8 senses per verb in
(Chen et al., 2006), where the experiments were con-
ducted using coarse-grained evaluation. Assuming
we have access to an “oracle” which determines the
predominant sense, or most frequent sense (MFS),
of each noun in our WSJ test data perfectly, and
we assign this most frequent sense to each noun in
the test data, we will have achieved an accuracy of
61.1% as shown in the column MFS accuracy of Ta-
ble 1. Finally, we note that we have an average of
310 BC training examples and 406 WSJ adaptation
examples per noun.

3 Active Learning
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999911">
For our experiments, we use naive Bayes as the
learning algorithm. The knowledge sources we use
include parts-of-speech, local collocations, and sur-
rounding words. These knowledge sources were ef-
fectively used to build a state-of-the-art WSD pro-
gram in one of our prior work (Lee and Ng, 2002).
In performing WSD with a naive Bayes classifier,
the sense s assigned to an example with features

In our domain adaptation study, we start with a
WSD system built using training examples drawn
from BC. We then investigate the utility of adding
additional in-domain training data from WSJ. In the
baseline approach, the additional WSJ examples are
randomly selected. With active learning (Lewis and
Gale, 1994), we use uncertainty sampling as shown

in Figure 1. In each iteration, we train a WSD sys-
tem on the available training data and apply it on the
WSJ adaptation examples. Among these WSJ ex-
amples, the example predicted with the lowest con-
fidence is selected and removed from the adaptation
data. The correct label is then supplied for this ex-
ample and it is added to the training data.
Note that in the experiments reported in this pa-
per, all the adaptation examples are already pre-
annotated before the experiments start, since all
the WSJ adaptation examples come from the DSO
corpus which have already been sense-annotated.
Hence, the annotation of an example needed during
each adaptation iteration is simulated by performing
a lookup without any manual annotation.

4 Count-merging
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999902">
We also employ a technique known as count-
merging in our domain adaptation study. Count-
merging assigns different weights to different ex-
amples to better reflect their relative importance.
Roark and Bacchiani (2003) showed that weighted
count-merging is a special case of maximum a pos-
teriori (MAP) estimation, and successfully used it
for probabilistic context-free grammar domain adap-
tation (Roark and Bacchiani, 2003) and language
model adaptation (Bacchiani and Roark, 2003).
Count-merging can be regarded as scaling of
counts obtained from different data sets. We let
c denote the counts from out-of-domain training
data, c� denote the counts from in-domain adapta-
tion data, and p� denote the probability estimate by

count-merging. We can scale the out-of-domain and
in-domain counts with different factors, or just use a
single weight parameter β:

Similarly,
ec(si) + β¯c(si)
bp(si) = (2)
ec + β¯c
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999947285714286">
Obtaining an optimum value for β is not the focus
of this work. Instead, we are interested to see if as-
signing a higher weight to the in-domain WSJ adap-
tation examples, as compared to the out-of-domain
BC examples, will improve the adaptation process.
Hence, we just use a β value of 3 in our experiments
involving count-merging.

5 Estimating Sense Priors
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999555">
In this section, we describe an EM-based algorithm
that was introduced by Saerens et al. (2002), which
can be used to estimate the sense priors, or a priori
probabilities of the different senses in a new dataset.
We have recently shown that this algorithm is effec-
tive in estimating the sense priors of a set of nouns
(Chan and Ng, 2005).
Most of this section is based on (Saerens et al.,
2002). Assume we have a set of labeled data DL
with n classes and a set of N independent instances
(x1, ... , xN) from a new data set. The likelihood of
these N instances can be defined as:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.999581285714286">
L(x1, ... , xN) =
Y&amp;quot; N n
Xp(xk,ωi)
k=1 i=1
&amp;quot; Nn
Xp(xk|ωi)p(ωi) (3)
k=1 i=1
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999954583333333">
Assuming the within-class densities p(xk|ωi), i.e.,
the probabilities of observing xk given the class ωi,
do not change from the training set DL to the new
data set, we can define: p(xk|ωi) = pL(xk|ωi). To
determine the a priori probability estimates bp(ωi) of
the new data set that will maximize the likelihood of
(3) with respect to p(ωi), we can apply the iterative
procedure of the EM algorithm. In effect, through
maximizing the likelihood of (3), we obtain the a
priori probability estimates as a by-product.
Let us now define some notations. When we ap-
ply a classifier trained on DL on an instance xk
drawn from the new data set DU, we get bpL(ωi|xk),
which we define as the probability of instance xk
being classified as class ωi by the classifier trained
on DL. Further, let us define bpL(ωi) as the a pri-
ori probability of class ωi in DL. This can be esti-
mated by the class frequency of ωi in DL. We also
define bp(s)(ωi) and bp(s)(ωi|xk) as estimates of the
new a priori and a posteriori probabilities at step s
of the iterative EM procedure. Assuming we initial-
ize bp(�)(ωi) = bpL(ωi), then for each instance xk in
DU and each class ωi, the EM algorithm provides
the following iterative steps:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.999536833333333">
Pnj=1 bpL(ωj|xk) �p�s�(ωj)

k=1 bp(s)(ωi|xk) (5)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999937">
where Equation (4) represents the expectation E-
step, Equation (5) represents the maximization M-
step, and N represents the number of instances in
DU. Note that the probabilities bpL(ωi|xk) and
bpL(ωi) in Equation (4) will stay the same through-
out the iterations for each particular instance xk
and class ωi. The new a posteriori probabilities
bp(s)(ωi|xk) at step s in Equation (4) are simply the
a posteriori probabilities in the conditions of the la-
beled data, bpL(ωi|xk), weighted by the ratio of the
new priors bp(s)(ωi) to the old priors bpL(ωi). The de-
nominator in Equation (4) is simply a normalizing
factor.
The a posteriori bp(s)(ωi|xk) and a priori proba-
bilities bp(s)(ωi) are re-estimated sequentially dur-
ing each iterations for each new instance xk and
each class ωi, until the convergence of the estimated
probabilities bp(s)(ωi), which will be our estimated
sense priors. This iterative procedure will increase
the likelihood of (3) at each step.

ation, WSJ adaptation examples are selected one at
a time and added to the training set. The adaptation
process continues until all the adaptation examples
are added. Classification accuracies averaged over
3 random trials on the WSJ test examples at each
iteration are calculated. Since the number of WSJ
adaptation examples differs for each of the 21 nouns,
the learning curves we will show in the various fig-
ures are plotted in terms of different percentage of
adaptation examples added, varying from 0 to 100
percent in steps of 1 percent. To obtain these curves,
we first calculate for each noun, the WSD accuracy
when different percentages of adaptation examples
are added. Then, for each percentage, we calculate
the macro-average WSD accuracy over all the nouns
to obtain a single learning curve representing all the
nouns.

6.1 Utility of Active Learning and
Count-merging

<bodyText confidence="0.999997653846154">
In Figure 2, the curve r represents the adaptation
process of the baseline approach, where additional
WSJ examples are randomly selected during each
adaptation iteration. The adaptation process using
active learning is represented by the curve a, while
applying count-merging with active learning is rep-
resented by the curve a-c. Note that random selec-
tion r achieves its highest WSD accuracy after all
the adaptation examples are added. To reach the
same accuracy, the a approach requires the addition
of only 57% of adaptation examples. The a-c ap-
proach is even more effective and requires only 42%
of adaptation examples. This demonstrates the ef-
fectiveness of count-merging in further reducing the
annotation effort, when compared to using only ac-
tive learning. To reach the MFS accuracy of 61.1%
as shown earlier in Table 1, a-c requires just 4% of
the adaptation examples.
To determine the utility of the out-of-domain BC
examples, we have also conducted three active learn-
ing runs using only WSJ adaptation examples. Us-
ing 10%, 20%, and 30% of WSJ adaptation exam-
ples to build a classifier, the accuracy of these runs
is lower than the active learning a curve and paired
t-tests show that the difference is statistically signif-
icant at the level of significance 0.01.

6.2 Using Sense Priors Information
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999753766666667">
As mentioned in section 1, research in (Escudero et
al., 2000) noted an improvement in accuracy when
they adjusted the BC and WSJ datasets such that
the proportions of the different senses of each word
were the same between BC and WSJ. We can simi-
larly choose BC examples such that the sense priors
in the BC training data adhere to the sense priors in
the WSJ evaluation data. To gauge the effectiveness
of this approach, we first assume that we know the
true sense priors of each noun in the WSJ evalua-
tion data. We then gather BC training examples for
a noun to adhere as much as possible to the sense
priors in WSJ. Assume sense si is the predominant
sense in the WSJ evaluation data, si has a sense prior
of pi in the WSJ data and has ni BC training exam-
ples. Taking ni examples to represent a sense prior
of pi, we proportionally determine the number of BC
examples to gather for other senses s according to
their respective sense priors in WSJ. If there are in-
sufficient training examples in BC for some sense s,
whatever available examples of s are used.
This approach gives an average of 195 BC train-
ing examples for the 21 nouns. With this new set
of training examples, we perform adaptation using
active learning and obtain the a-truePrior curve in
Figure 2. The a-truePrior curve shows that by en-
suring that the sense priors in the BC training data
adhere as much as possible to the sense priors in the
WSJ data, we start off with a higher WSD accuracy.

A possible reason might be that by strictly adhering
to the sense priors in the WSJ data, we have removed
too many BC training examples, from an average of
310 examples per noun as shown in Table 1, to an
average of 195 examples.

6.3 Using Predominant Sense Information
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999913475">
Research by McCarthy et al. (2004) and Koeling et
al. (2005) pointed out that a change of predominant
sense is often indicative of a change in domain. For
example, the predominant sense of the noun interest
in the BC part of the DSO corpus has the meaning
“a sense of concern with and curiosity about some-
one or something”. In the WSJ part of the DSO cor-
pus, the noun interest has a different predominant
sense with the meaning “a fixed charge for borrow-
ing money”, which is reflective of the business and
finance focus of the WSJ corpus.
Instead of restricting the BC training data to ad-
here strictly to the sense priors in WSJ, another alter-
native is just to ensure that the predominant sense in
BC is the same as that of WSJ. Out of the 21 nouns,
12 nouns have the same predominant sense in both
BC and WSJ. The remaining 9 nouns that have dif-
ferent predominant senses in the BC and WSJ data
are: center, field, figure, interest, line, need, order,
term, value. The row 9 nouns in Table 1 gives some
information for this set of 9 nouns. To gauge the
utility of this approach, we conduct experiments on
these nouns by first assuming that we know the true
predominant sense in the WSJ data. Assume that the
WSJ predominant sense of a noun is sz and sz has nz
examples in the BC data. We then gather BC exam-
ples for a noun to adhere to this WSJ predominant
sense, by gathering only up to nz BC examples for
each sense of this noun. This approach gives an av-
erage of 190 BC examples for the 9 nouns. This is
higher than an average of 83 BC examples for these
9 nouns if BC examples are selected to follow the
sense priors of WSJ evaluation data as described in
the last subsection 6.2.
For these 9 nouns, the average KL-divergence be-
tween the sense priors of the original BC data and
WSJ evaluation data is 0.81. This drops to 0.51 af-
ter ensuring that the predominant sense in BC is the
same as that of WSJ, confirming that the sense priors
in the newly gathered BC data more closely follow

the sense priors in WSJ. Using this new set of train-
ing examples, we perform domain adaptation using
active learning to obtain the curve a-truePred in Fig-
ure 3. For comparison, we also plot the curves a
and a-truePrior for this set of 9 nouns in Figure 3.
Results in Figure 3 show that a-truePred starts off
at a higher accuracy and performs consistently bet-
ter than the a curve. In contrast, though a-truePrior
starts at a high accuracy, its performance is lower
than a-truePred and a after 50% of adaptation ex-
amples are added. The approach represented by a-
truePred is a compromise between ensuring that the
sense priors in the training data follow as closely
as possible the sense priors in the evaluation data,
while retaining enough training examples. These re-
sults highlight the importance of striking a balance
between these two goals.
In (McCarthy et al., 2004), a method was pre-
sented to determine the predominant sense of a word
in a corpus. However, in (Chan and Ng, 2005),
we showed that in a supervised setting where one
has access to some annotated training data, the EM-
based method in section 5 estimates the sense priors
more effectively than the method described in (Mc-
Carthy et al., 2004). Hence, we use the EM-based
algorithm to estimate the sense priors in the WSJ
evaluation data for each of the 21 nouns. The sense
with the highest estimated sense prior is taken as the

sense remains unchanged between BC and WSJ, the
EM-based algorithm is able to predict that the pre-
dominant sense remains unchanged for all 12 nouns.
Hence, we will focus on the 9 nouns which have
different predominant senses between BC and WSJ
for our remaining adaptation experiments. For these
9 nouns, the EM-based algorithm correctly predicts
the WSJ predominant sense for 6 nouns. Hence, the
algorithm is able to predict the correct predominant
sense for 18 out of 21 nouns overall, representing an
accuracy of 86%.
Figure 4 plots the curve a-estPred, which is simi-
lar to a-truePred, except that the predominant sense
is now estimated by the EM-based algorithm. Em-
ploying count-merging with a-estPred produces the
curve a-c-estPred. For comparison, the curves r, a,
and a-truePred are also plotted. The results show
that a-estPred performs consistently better than a,
and a-c-estPred in turn performs better than a-
estPred. Hence, employing the predicted predom-
inant sense and count-merging, we further improve
the effectiveness of the active learning-based adap-
tation process.
With reference to Figure 4, the WSD accuracies
of the r and a curves before and after adaptation
are 43.7% and 78.4% respectively. Starting from
the mid-point 61.1% accuracy, which represents a
50% accuracy increase from 43.7%, we show in
Table 2 the percentage of adaptation examples re-
quired by the various approaches to reach certain
levels of WSD accuracies. For instance, to reach
the final accuracy of 78.4%, r, a, a-estPred, and a-
c-estPred require the addition of 100%, 51%, 38%,
and 29% adaptation examples respectively. The
numbers in brackets give the ratio of adaptation ex-
amples needed by a, a-estPred, and a-c-estPred ver-
sus random selection r. For instance, to reach a
WSD accuracy of 78.4%, a-c-estPred needs only
29% adaptation examples, representing a ratio of
0.29 and an annotation saving of 71%. Note that this
represents a more effective adaptation process than
the basic active learning a approach, which requires
51% adaptation examples. Hence, besides showing
that active learning can be used to reduce the annota-
tion effort required for domain adaptation, we have
further improved the effectiveness of the adaptation
process by using the predicted predominant sense
of the new domain and adopting the count-merging
technique.

Domain adaptation is important to ensure the gen-
eral applicability of WSD systems across different
domains. In this paper, we have shown that active
learning is effective in reducing the annotation ef-
fort required in porting a WSD system to a new do-
main. Also, we have successfully used an EM-based
algorithm to detect a change in predominant sense
between the training and new domain. With this
information on the predominant sense of the new
domain and incorporating count-merging, we have
shown that we are able to improve the effectiveness
of the original adaptation process achieved by the
basic active learning approach.

Countmerging assigns different weights to different examples to better reflect their relative importance. Roark and Bacchiani (2003) showed that weighted count-merging is a special case of maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation, and successfully used it for probabilistic context-free grammar domain adaptation (Roark and Bacchiani, 2003) and language model adaptation (Bacchiani and Roark, 2003). Count-merging can be regarded as scaling of counts obtained from different data sets. We let c denote the counts from out-of-domain training data, c� denote the counts from in-domain adaptation data, and p� denote the probability estimate by n H =1 p(s) p(f,|s) 51 count-merging. We can scale the out-of-domain and in-domain counts with different factors, or just use a single weight parameter β: Similarly, ec(si) + β¯c(si) bp(si) = (2) ec + β¯c Obtaining an optimum value for β is not the focus of this work.

Hence, we just use a β value of 3 in our experiments involving count-merging. 5 Estimating Sense Priors In this section, we describe an EM-based algorithm that was introduced by Saerens et al. (2002), which can be used to estimate the sense priors, or a priori probabilities of the different senses in a new dataset. We have recently shown that this algorithm is effective in estimating the sense priors of a set of nouns (Chan and Ng, 2005). Most of this section is based on (Saerens et al., 2002). Assume we have a set of labeled data DL with n classes and a set of N independent instances (x1, ... , xN) from a new data set. The likelihood of these N instances can be defined as: L(x1, ... , xN) = Y&amp;quot; N n Xp(xk,ωi) k=1 i=1 &amp;quot; Nn Xp(xk|ωi)p(ωi) (3) k=1 i=1 Assuming the within-class densities p(xk|ωi), i.e., the probabilities of observing xk given the class ωi, do not change from the training set DL to the new data set, we can define: p(xk|ωi) = pL(xk|ωi). To determine the a priori probability estimates bp(ωi) of the new data set that </context>

In contrast, though a-truePrior starts at a high accuracy, its performance is lower than a-truePred and a after 50% of adaptation examples are added. The approach represented by atruePred is a compromise between ensuring that the sense priors in the training data follow as closely as possible the sense priors in the evaluation data, while retaining enough training examples. These results highlight the importance of striking a balance between these two goals. In (McCarthy et al., 2004), a method was presented to determine the predominant sense of a word in a corpus. However, in (Chan and Ng, 2005), we showed that in a supervised setting where one has access to some annotated training data, the EMbased method in section 5 estimates the sense priors more effectively than the method described in (McCarthy et al., 2004). Hence, we use the EM-based algorithm to estimate the sense priors in the WSJ evaluation data for each of the 21 nouns. The sense with the highest estimated sense prior is taken as the predominant sense of the noun.

In this paper, we explore domain adaptation of WSD systems, by adding training examples from the new domain as additional training data to a WSD system. To reduce the effort required to adapt a WSD system to a new domain, we employ an active learning strategy (Lewis and Gale, 1994) to select examples to annotate from the new domain of interest. To our knowledge, our work is the first to use active learning for domain adaptation for WSD. A similar work is the recent research by Chen et al. (2006), where active learning was used successfully to reduce the annotation effort for WSD of 5 English verbs using coarse-grained evaluation. In that work, the authors only used active learning to reduce the annotation effort and did not deal with the porting of a WSD system to a new domain. Domain adaptation is necessary when the training and target domains are different.

Assuming we have access to an “oracle” which determines the predominant sense, or most frequent sense (MFS), of each noun in our WSJ test data perfectly, and we assign this most frequent sense to each noun in the test data, we will have achieved an accuracy of 61.1% as shown in the column MFS accuracy of Table 1.

To date, the best performing systems in WSD use a corpus-based, supervised learning approach. With this approach, one would need to collect a text corpus, in which each ambiguous word occurrence is first tagged with its correct sense to serve as training data. The reliance of supervised WSD systems on annotated corpus raises the important issue of domain dependence. To investigate this, Escudero et al. (2000) and Martinez and Agirre (2000) conducted experiments using the DSO corpus, which 49 contains sentences from two different corpora, namely Brown Corpus (BC) and Wall Street Journal (WSJ). They found that training a WSD system on one part (BC or WSJ) of the DSO corpus, and applying it to the other, can result in an accuracy drop of more than 10%, highlighting the need to perform domain adaptation of WSD systems to new domains. Escudero et al. (2000) pointed out that one of the reasons for the drop in accuracy is the difference in sense priors (i.e., the proportions of the different senses of a </context>

While the BC is built as a balanced corpus, containing texts in various categories such as religion, politics, humanities, fiction, etc, the WSJ corpus consists primarily of business and financial news. Exploiting the difference in coverage between these two corpora, Escudero et al. (2000) separated the DSO corpus into 50 2.2 Choice of Nouns The WordNet Domains resource (Magnini and Cavaglia, 2000) assigns domain labels to synsets in WordNet.

To reach the MFS accuracy of 61.1% as shown earlier in Table 1, a-c requires just 4% of the adaptation examples. To determine the utility of the out-of-domain BC examples, we have also conducted three active learning runs using only WSJ adaptation examples. Using 10%, 20%, and 30% of WSJ adaptation examples to build a classifier, the accuracy of these runs is lower than the active learning a curve and paired t-tests show that the difference is statistically significant at the level of significance 0.01. 6.2 Using Sense Priors Information As mentioned in section 1, research in (Escudero et al., 2000) noted an improvement in accuracy when they adjusted the BC and WSJ datasets such that the proportions of the different senses of each word were the same between BC and WSJ. We can similarly choose BC examples such that the sense priors in the BC training data adhere to the sense priors in the WSJ evaluation data. To gauge the effectiveness of this approach, we first assume that we know the true sense priors of each noun in the WSJ evaluation data.

This gives a set of 21 nouns: book, business, center, community, condition, field, figure, house, interest, land, line, money, need, number, order, part, power, society, term, use, value.2 For each noun, all the BC examples are used as out-of-domain training data.

In the WSJ part of the DSO corpus, the noun interest has a different predominant sense with the meaning “a fixed charge for borrowing money”, which is reflective of the business and finance focus of the WSJ corpus.

To date, the best performing systems in WSD use a corpus-based, supervised learning approach. With this approach, one would need to collect a text corpus, in which each ambiguous word occurrence is first tagged with its correct sense to serve as training data. The reliance of supervised WSD systems on annotated corpus raises the important issue of domain dependence. To investigate this, Escudero et al. (2000) and Martinez and Agirre (2000) conducted experiments using the DSO corpus, which 49 contains sentences from two different corpora, namely Brown Corpus (BC) and Wall Street Journal (WSJ). They found that training a WSD system on one part (BC or WSJ) of the DSO corpus, and applying it to the other, can result in an accuracy drop of more than 10%, highlighting the need to perform domain adaptation of WSD systems to new domains. Escudero et al. (2000) pointed out that one of the reasons for the drop in accuracy is the difference in sense priors (i.e., the proportions of the different senses of a word) between BC and WSJ.

However, in (Chan and Ng, 2005), we showed that in a supervised setting where one has access to some annotated training data, the EMbased method in section 5 estimates the sense priors more effectively than the method described in (McCarthy et al., 2004).

Note that in the experiments reported in this paper, all the adaptation examples are already preannotated before the experiments start, since all the WSJ adaptation examples come from the DSO corpus which have already been sense-annotated. Hence, the annotation of an example needed during each adaptation iteration is simulated by performing a lookup without any manual annotation. 4 Count-merging We also employ a technique known as countmerging in our domain adaptation study. Countmerging assigns different weights to different examples to better reflect their relative importance. Roark and Bacchiani (2003) showed that weighted count-merging is a special case of maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation, and successfully used it for probabilistic context-free grammar domain adaptation (Roark and Bacchiani, 2003) and language model adaptation (Bacchiani and Roark, 2003). Count-merging can be regarded as scaling of counts obtained from different data sets. We let c denote the counts from out-of-domain training data, c� denote the counts from in-domain adaptation data, and p� denote the probability estimate by n H =1 p(s) p(f,|s) 51 count-merging.
