The Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm is used to train the model, guaranteeing that each EM iteration will increase the training likelihood. However, because the latent variable grammars are not explicitly regularized, EM keeps fitting the training data and eventually begins overfitting (Liang et al., 2007). Moreover, EM is a local method, making no promises regarding the final point of convergence when initialized from different random seeds. Recently, Petrov (2010) showed that substantial differences between the learned grammars remain, even if the hierarchical splitting reduces the variance across independent runs of EM. In order to counteract the overfitting behavior, Petrov et al. (2006) introduced a linear smoothing procedure that allows training grammars for 6 splitmerge (SM) rounds without overfitting. The increased expressiveness of the model, combined with the more robust parameter estimates provided by the smoothing, results in a nice increase in parsing accuracy on a held-out set.

The observation of variation is not surprising; EM\u2019s tendency to get stuck in local maxima has been studied extensively in the literature, resulting in various proposals for model selection methods (e.g., see 12 Proceedings of the 2010 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pages 12\u201322, MIT, Massachusetts, USA, 9-11 October 2010. c�2010 Association for Computational Linguistics Burnham and Anderson (2002)). What is perhaps more surprising is that the different latent variable grammars seem to capture complementary aspects of the data. Petrov (2010) showed that a simple randomization scheme produces widely varying grammars. Quite serendipitously, these grammars can be combined into an unweighted product model that substantially outperforms the individual grammars. In this paper, we combine the ideas of selftraining and product models and show that both techniques provide complementary effects. We hypothesize that the main factors contributing to the final accuracy of the product model of self-trained grammars are (i) the accuracy of the grammar used to parse the unlabeled data for retraining (single grammar versus product of grammars) an","@endWordPosition":"614","@position":"4031","annotationId":"T4","@startWordPosition":"613","@citStr":"Petrov (2010)"},{"#tail":"\n","#text":"d of parse trees and sentences. To allocate the grammar complexity only where needed, a simple split-and-merge procedure is applied. In every splitmerge (SM) round, each latent variable is first split in two and the model is re-estimated. A likelihood criterion is used to merge back the least useful splits (50% merge rate for these experiments). This iterative refinement proceeds for 7 rounds, at which point parsing performance on a held-out set levels off and training becomes prohibitively slow. Since EM is a local method, different initializations will result in different grammars. In fact, Petrov (2010) recently showed that this EMalgorithm is very unstable and converges to widely varying local maxima.

This is very useful for practical reasons because a single grammar is faster to parse with and requires less memory than the product model. The product of the SM6 ST-Prod grammars also achieves a 0.2 higher F score compared to the product of the SM6 ST-Reg grammars, but the product of the SM7 ST-Prod grammars has the same performance as the product of the SM7 ST-Reg grammars. This could be due to the fact that the ST-Prod grammars are no more diverse than the ST-Reg grammars, as we will show in Section 5. 4.4 ST-Prod-Mult Training When creating a product model of regular grammars, Petrov (2010) used a different random seed for each model and conjectured that the effectiveness of the product grammars stems from the resulting diversity of the individual grammars. Two ways to systematically introduce bias into individual models are to either modify the feature sets (Baldridge and Osborne, 2008; Smith and Osborne, 2007) or to change the training distributions of the individual models (Breiman, 1996).

One possible explanation of the observation in the previous subsection is that with the addition of more latent variables, the individual grammars become more deeply specialized on certain aspects of the training data. This specialization leads to greater diversity in their prediction preferences, especially in the presence of a small training set. On the other hand, the self-labeled training set size is much larger, and so the specialization process is therefore slowed down. Petrov (2010) showed that the individually learned grammars are indeed very diverse by looking at the distribution of latent annotations across the treebank categories, as well as the variation in overall and individual category F scores (see Figure 1). However, these measures do not directly relate to the diversity of the prediction preferences of the grammars, as we observed similar patterns in the regular and self-trained models.

The product of the ST-Prod-Mult grammars provides further and significant improvement in F score. 6 Final Results We evaluated the best single self-trained grammar (SM7 ST-Prod), as well as the product of the SM7 ST-Prod-Mult grammars on the WSJ test set. Table 7 compares these two grammars to a large body of related work grouped into single parsers (SINGLE), discriminative reranking approaches (RE), self-training (SELF), and system combinations (COMBO). Our best single grammar achieves an accuracy that is only slightly worse (91.6 vs. 91.8 in F score) than the product model in Petrov (2010). This is made possible by self-training on the output of a high quality product model. The higher quality of the automatically parsed data results in a 0.3 point higher final F score (91.6 vs. 91.3) over the selftraining results in Huang and Harper (2009), which used a single grammar for parsing the unlabeled data.
